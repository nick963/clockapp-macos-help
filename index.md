### Getting Started

JSON Clock displays clocks in a circular window. You can move, resize, and load clocks in JSON format.

### Moving the Window

Click and drag anywhere inside the circular window to move it around the screen.

### Resizing the Window

Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and click-drag to resize the window. Expand the window by moving down to the right. The window maintains a square aspect ratio.

### Opening Clocks

Use <strong>File → Open…</strong> to load additional clocks that conform to the app’s schema.

### Built-in Clocks

The app comes with preloaded clocks. Each one can be selected and viewed without opening external JSON files.

### Viewing JSON

Use the <string>JSON → Open…</strong> to load additional clocks that conform to the app’s schema. You can inspect and learn from the existing JSON.
