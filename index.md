### Getting Started

MyClockApp displays clocks in a circular window. You can move, resize, and load clocks in JSON format.

### Moving the Window

Click and drag anywhere inside the circular window to move it around the screen.

### Resizing the Window

Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and click-drag to resize the window. The window maintains a square aspect ratio.

### Opening Clocks

Use <strong>File → Open Clock JSON…</strong> to load additional clocks that conform to the app’s schema.

### Built-in Clocks

The app comes with 20 preloaded clocks. Each one can be selected and viewed without opening external JSON files.

### Viewing Clock JSON

Use the JSON panel to view the definition of any clock. You can inspect and learn from the existing JSON.
