## JSON Format

The clock's JSON format is minimal. Here is a basic example:

```json
{
  "name": "Name of Clock",
  "description": "Description of the clock."
  "clock_face": [
  {
      "shape": "circle",
      "circle_radius": 1,
      "x": 0.0,
      "y": 0.0,
      "color": "#FFFFFF"}
  ],
  "second_hand": [
  {
      "shape": "rectangle",
      "color": "#FF0000",
      "rectangle_fx": -0.01, "rectangle_fy": -0.99,
      "rectangle_tx":  0.01, "rectangle_ty":  0.10
    }
  ],
  "minute_hand": [
    {
      "shape": "rectangle",
      "rectangle_fx": -0.016, "rectangle_fy": -0.99,
      "rectangle_tx":  0.016, "rectangle_ty":  0.10
    }
  ],
  "hour_hand": [
    {
      "shape": "rectangle",
      "rectangle_fx": -0.016, "rectangle_fy": -0.69,
      "rectangle_tx":  0.016, "rectangle_ty":  0.10
    }
  ]
}
```

| minute_hand       | List of shapes for the clock's minute hand.                                                          |
| hour_hand         | List of shapes for the clock's hour hand.                                                            |

### JSON Shapes Schema

#### Key Characteristics of the Coordinate System

- **Origin**: The origin is in the center of the clock face.
- **X-axis**: The x-values increase as you move to the right. This is the same as a standard Cartesian coordinate
  system.
- **Y-axis**: The y-values increase as you move down. This is the opposite of a standard Cartesian system, where
  y-values
  increase as you move up. This is consistent with computer screens and visual displays.
- **Drawing Area**: The radius of the clock face is 1.0. The application will scale that clock if the user increases the
  size.

There are 4 shapes that can be used to construct the clocks: "rectangle", "polygon", "text", "circle".
