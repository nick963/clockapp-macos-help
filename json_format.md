## JSON Schema

The schema to define clocks in JSON is minimal:

```json
{
  "name": "Name of Clock",
  "clock_face": [],
  "second_hand": [],
  "minute_hand": [],
  "hour_hand": []
}
```

| clock object keys | key description                                                                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name              | Name of the clock.                                                                                   |
| description       | Description of the clock.                                                                            |
| clock_face        | List of shapes for the clock's face.                                                                 |
| second_hand       | List of shapes for the clock's second hand. It should be oriented towards 12:00 and will be rotated. |
| minute_hand       | List of shapes for the clock's minute hand.                                                          |
| hour_hand         | List of shapes for the clock's hour hand.                                                            |

### JSON Shapes Schema

#### Key Characteristics of the Coordinate System

- **Origin**: The origin is in the center of the clock face.
- **X-axis**: The x-values increase as you move to the right. This is the same as a standard Cartesian coordinate
  system.
- **Y-axis**: The y-values increase as you move down. This is the opposite of a standard Cartesian system, where
  y-values
  increase as you move up. This is consistent with computer screens and visual displays.
- **Drawing Area**: The radius of the clock face is 1.0. The application will scale that clock if the user increases the
  size.

There are 4 shapes that can be used to construct the clocks: "rectangle", "polygon", "text", "circle".
